### Process firefly transactions
#
# This action expects the github secret `PROCESS_FIREFLY_TRANSACTIONS` in
# the following format:
# ```json
# {
#   "nc_user": "user",
#   "nc_password": "password",
#   "firefly_users": [{
#     "pat": "eyJ0...",
#     "accounts": { "1": "Credit card", "2": "Cash" },
#     "cospend_payer_username": "user"
#   }, ...]
# }
# ```
# It should conform to the `PROCESS_FIREFLY_TRANSACTIONS` schema definition in
# `workflows/process-firefly-transactions/submit-to-cospend/src/model/program-inputs.ts`.
# The current secret value is saved in
# `workflows/process-firefly-transactions/secret.sops.yaml`.
#
# A transaction is expected to have a set of tags starting with `"cospend:"`
# describing metadata about transaction to be added to Cospend.
# All transactions tagged with `"cospend:done"` tag are considered as already
# processed, so they are skipped. Example tags for an incoming transaction:
# ```
# cospend:project:purchases
# cospend:for:user
# cospend:category:Grocery
# cospend:mode:Debit card
# ```
# All possible keys and values are described by `transactionConfigurationInputS`
# schema definition in
# `workflows/process-firefly-transactions/submit-to-cospend/src/model/program-inputs.ts`.
#
# Each transaction is processed by the script in
# `workflows/process-firefly-transactions/submit-to-cospend/`. It expects to
# receive, `nc_base_url`, `nc_user`, and `nc_password` as environment variables
# with the information how to connect and authenticate with nextcloud server.
# You should use username and application password of a user that permissions to
# create transactions in cospend project. The script also expects `input` env
# var, which is a JSON string describing loaded transaction. The `input` object
# should conform to the `fireflyTransactionInputS` schema defined in
# `workflows/process-firefly-transactions/submit-to-cospend/src/model/program-inputs.ts`.
#
# To test this workflow, perform the following steps:
# - Comment out `run_install` configuration to pnpm in this workflow.
# - Set `baseURL` in `on.script` to public firefly address.
# - Set `nc_base_url` and `ff3_base_rul` in env of `Process a transaction` step
#   to public nextcloud and firefly addresses.
# - In the `./workflows/test-locally.sh` script, set `INCLUDE` variable to the
#   name of this workflow file.
# - Run the script `./workflows/test-locally.sh`.
